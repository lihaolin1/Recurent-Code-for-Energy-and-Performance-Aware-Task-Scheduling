# Recurrent-Code-for-Energy-and-Performance-Aware-Task-Scheduling
Use C++ to recurrent Code from paper ["Energy and Performance-Aware Task Scheduling in a Mobile Cloud Computing Environment](http://www.mpedram.com/Papers/task-sched-MCC-cloud14.pdf), authors are Xue Lin, Yanzhi Wang, Qing Xie, Massoud Pedram 

The main idea in this paper is use some methods to scheduling all of the task will running on the multicore processor and cloud, in order to save time and energy as much as we can.

Inorder to use this code(in liniux system), follow the step shown below.   
1. copy the source code to your computer, rename it or not.  
2. go in to the file where you save this code.  
3. run command "g++ code_name.c -o code_name" to compile the code.  
4. run command "./code_name" to run code.  
5. input the variable, if you don't know what the input variables means, you can see "what_is_input.md" file.  
6. get the result
